CSS Refresher for VIM
=====================

Reloads the CSS files of the current Safari tab everytime a .css file is saved.

How to use:

 - Install this VIM plugin using pathogen.
   (alternatively, just copy the files to `~/.vim/plugin`)

 - Open your project in Safari. Make sure it's the front-most tab.

 - Open a CSS file in that project in VIM.

 - Make a few changes and save it.

 - Watch as how Safari refreshes your CSS changes!

Assumptions:

 - You're using a Mac (relies on AppleScript); and

 - Your browser of choice is Safari.

Caution: This is a quick and dirty hack, use at your own risk!
